Using stock_predict.py
======================

Check for the program options 

% ./stock_precict.py --help


1. Fetch all the data using the data gather option

% ./stock_predict.py --gather 

2. Check that the data has been retrieved

% ls data
% ls data/AAPL data/GOOG data/AMZN data/NFLX

  Stock data obtained from Yahoo Finance

% ls data/AAPL/AAPL-stock-data.csv

Files of the names like BATSshvol20170317.txt.zip are used to get the Short-Ratio 

3. Now do the prediction 

% ./stock_predict.py --summary 


stock  GOOG  predicted for  6-12-2017  is :  920.660193036
stock  AAPL  predicted for  6-12-2017  is :  154.113804227
stock  AMZN  predicted for  6-12-2017  is :  933.953044587
stock  NFLX  predicted for  6-12-2017  is :  158.83517277


4. if you would like to change the dates . edit the file stock_predict.py 
   and change the ticker symbols in the variable 'queries'

5. Benchmark 

% ./stock-predict.py -b svm 0.90

Here it takes the entire data from begin and end date, then splits it into 90%
as begin and end , the uses the remaining 10% as prediction date true values and 
uses the prediction method to check the accuracy of the algorithm. 
In this example we used "svm". We can also use "linear" for linear regression
